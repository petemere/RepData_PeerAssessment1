## Loading and preprocessing the data
First load the required packages.
```{r}
require('data.table')
require('ggplot2')
```

Then load the data into a data.table.
```{r}
stepDT <- read.table(unz('activity.zip', filename = 'activity.csv'), 
                     header = TRUE, sep = ',', 
                     colClasses = c('numeric','Date','numeric'), 
                     stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
stepDT <- as.data.table(stepDT)
```

## What is the average daily activity pattern?
